### Business Problem
In this study, I am going to design an A/B test for a planned a change to be deployed in a e-commerce website and give recommendations based on the results. The company is planing to deploy a recommendation engine which is tought to be offering right products to the website visitors after clicking "Buy a product" button. However this change may harm or improve the company's bussiness, at this point A/B testing is necessary.
